In this project we are not going to use any devops tools ,purely by using the
services that are available in AWS, Here we are going to learn how to deploy 
a 3 Tier Architecture by using the AWS services.  
Discover the power of 3-Tier Architecture!
A 3-Tier Architecture app separates the presentation, application, and database layers, 
enhancing scalability, manageability, and security. 
This project showcases a robust AWS implementation of the architecture.
